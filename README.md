# kevin-leetcode-challenge
I have a friend who is currently a web developer has challenged me to submit atleast 1 leetcode problem per day or I have to pay him 5$ as the penalty.
But the truth is he can not even get 1 cent from me. I gotta show him what is the result for messing around with me.

## Shame board
